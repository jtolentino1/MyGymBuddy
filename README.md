 ## What can be improved?
 
 < Some of the biggest issues that we faced were having one camera connected at a time, which prevented us from being able to have as many excerises as we wanted to. One reason why this is important and an improvement is that we can have more excersies and can have the user decide how they want to do their workout with having the need to move the camera.  >
